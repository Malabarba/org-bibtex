This is a paper I have scheduled when I want to read. 
Once I do, I'll write notes here in this space.

** Thermodynamic Work Gain from Entanglement

- The work that can be extracted from a quantum system is higher when
  it contains quantum correlations.
- A feedback system between 2 qubits and a measurement device (each of
  these in contact with a different thermal reservoir) is used.
- Total work extracted is proportional to the internal energy between the two
  qubits and the measurement device, which is the classical
  entanglement plus the quantum entanglement.
